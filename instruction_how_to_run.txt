How to run the project?
1. The source code contains two main project folders.

2. ClientApp folder holds the client-side Angular project.

3. APIServer folder holds the server-side .NET project.

4. There is already a compiled version of the client-side project inside the "wwwwroot" folder of the server-side project.

5. The server-side app uses sqLite database with sample data seeded.

6. To start with a blank slate database, uncomment line#56 in AccountAPIController in the APIServer folder - to create roles.

7. Navigate to ClientApp and in Services >> calendar.service.ts and remote-connect.service.ts --> change the URL for 
"this.site" to the location of where you're hosting the server-side project.

8. To rebuild the client-side, run "ng build --prod --bh /dist/" inside the ClientApp folder. 

9. Copy the newly created "dist" folder in ClientApp folder, and replace the current dist folder inside "wwwwroot" folder in APIServer folder with this new copied item.

10. Host it up with the service of your choice.
